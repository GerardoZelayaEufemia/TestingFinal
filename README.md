This file should contain all the instructions to all collaborators. 
Think about how you want to handle this project and put it here. 
(1) I am in my desktop and I want to improve this file. Say I wrote a few lines. 
(2) Again I am in my desktop having troubles on how to send this changes and commit them if possible.
(3) I want to see if I can push this new README.md
